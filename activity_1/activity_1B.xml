[1] -> The activity statement doesn't give any information about namespaces 
(xmlns), hence we neither include any reference to it in the schema root element 
declaration, nor to the "targetNamespace" attribute (the XML Schema will be 
assigned to the NULL namespace).

[2] -> NOTES ABOUT ELEMENTS & ATTRIBUTES DEFINITIONS:

  [2.1] -> ELEMENT "COVID":  

    [2.1.1] -> ATTRIBUTE "id": since this is a key field, it must be declared as 
               a mandatory attribute. To do so, we have to explicitly declare it 
               with the "use" attribute, as well as the "required" attribute 
               (references: module 2, page 49). On the other hand, this attribute
               needs to be restricted to values in between 1-9999, thus we also 
               might have to declare this integer attribute as a simpleType and then
               apply a "range" restriction to its values by means of the "minInclusive" 
               & "maxInclusive" attributes (references: module 2, page 52). 

  [2.2] -> SUB-ELEMENT "date": Must be a complex type defined as a SEQUENCE (references: 
           module 2 page 48). 

    [2.2.1] -> SUB-ELEMENTS "day", "month" & "year": we could define these as "simpleType" 
               elements along with the "restriction" subelement in order to validate that 
               these three elements contain an Integer value (and nothing else).

  [2.3] -> SUB-ELEMENT "region": The activity statement does not stablish any constraint
           about this element, hence we can simply declare it as a complexType with no 
           constraints at all.

  [2.4] -> SUB-ELEMENT "patients": Since this element can only be repeated as much as 10 
           times, we must stablish the cardinality of this complexType element by means 
           of the minOccurs and maxOccurs attributes (references: module 2, page 49).

    [2.4.1] -> SUB-ELEMENT "gender": Must be a simpleType defined as an ENUMERATION 
               (references: module 2 page 48)
