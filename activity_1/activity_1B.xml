 [1] -> Since the activity statement doesn't give any information about namespaces 
        (xmlns), hence we do not include any reference to it in the schema root element 
        declaration. However, we do include the "targetNamespace" attribute in order to set
        a context where the XML Schema will be created (otherwise, the XML Schema 
        would have been assigned to the NULL namespace). 
        EDIT 01/11/2020 12:45 -> I've raised a question in the forum in regards to 
        this matter.

 [2] -> DEFINITIONS (NODES/ELEMENTS & ATTRIBUTES):

	[2.1] -> NODE "COVID":  

		[2.1.1] -> ATTRIBUTE "id": since this is a key field, it must be declared as 
                   a mandatory attribute. To do so, we have to explicitly declare it 
                   with the "use" attribute, as well as the "required" attribute 
                   (references: module 2, page 49)

	[2.2] -> NODE "date": Must be a complex type defined as a SEQUENCE (references: 
             module 2 page 48). 

		[2.2.1] -> ATTRIBUTES "day", "month" & "year": in order to validate that these
			       attributes are integers......... (CHECK THE FORUM, THERE IS A 
             QUESTION RELATED TO THIS)

	[2.3] -> NODE "region": 

	[2.4] -> NODE "patients": We must stablish the cardinality of this element by means 
             of the minOccurs and maxOccurs attributes (references: module 2, page 49).
		
		[2.4.1] -> Attribute "gender": Must be a complex type defined as a CHOICE 
                   (references: module 2 page 48)
