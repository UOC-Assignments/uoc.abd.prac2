[1] -> Since the activity statement doesn't give any information about namespaces 
(xmlns), hence we do not include any reference to it in the schema root element 
declaration. However, we do include the "targetNamespace" attribute in order 
to set a context where the XML Schema will be created (otherwise, the XML Schema 
would have been assigned to the NULL namespace). 
EDIT 01/11/2020 12:45 -> I've raised a question in the forum in regards to 
this matter.

[2] -> SOME NOTES ABOUT ELEMENTS DEFINITION:

  [2.1] -> ELEMENT "COVID":  

    [2.1.1] -> ATTRIBUTE "id": since this is a key field, it must be declared as 
               a mandatory attribute. To do so, we have to explicitly declare it 
               with the "use" attribute, as well as the "required" attribute 
               (references: module 2, page 49). On the other hand, this attribute
               needs to be restricted to values in between 1-9999, thus we also 
               must use the attributes "minInclusive" & "maxInclusive" (references: 
               module 2, page 52) -> THIS MIGHT BE WRONG SINCE MININCLUSIVE & MAXINCLUSIVE ARE SympleType ATTRIBUTES. 

  [2.2] -> SUB-ELEMENT "date": Must be a complex type defined as a SEQUENCE (references: 
           module 2 page 48). 

    [2.2.1] -> SUB-ELEMENTS "day", "month" & "year": we could define a "simpleType" element
               along with the "restriction" sub-element in order to validate that these
               subelements contain an Integer value (and nothing else).

  [2.3] -> SUB-ELEMENT "region": Since the activity statement does not stablish any constraint
           about......................

  [2.4] -> SUB-ELEMENT "patients": Since this element can only be repeated as much as 10 
           times, we must stablish the cardinality of this element by means of the 
           minOccurs and maxOccurs attributes (references: module 2, page 49).

    [2.4.1] -> SUB-ELEMENT "gender": Must be a complex type defined as a CHOICE 
               (references: module 2 page 48)
